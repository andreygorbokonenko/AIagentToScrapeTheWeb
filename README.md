# AIagentToScrapeTheWeb
Simple way to set up an open source AI agent to scrape the web.

Here we will set up an agent that will be capable of scraping the web for us. All tools we will use are open source and free to use, which makes this simple solution for available to anyone. 

Tools we will use:
1) Linux Machine
1) AnythingLLM - a simple interface for a local model.
2) 

**SECTION 1: Download and install AnythingLLM**

First, go to https://anythingllm.com/ and click **"Download for Desktop"** button

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0232931-5c31-493e-852f-8fd5484c7ae8)

I am using Linux, so I will choose **"Download for Linux"**
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9927c8f2-6b45-4b8d-8d7f-5b104286c435)

I will make it simple and use the following scripts from the instructions given for Linux
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b48c676-aedf-4e99-a93d-381ed4f39d98)

You can simply copy the command below, or get it from the website.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://cdn.useanything.com/latest/installer.sh | sh
```

After the command is executed, you should receive the following confirmation of installation in your terminal and AnythingLLM will be installed on your computer.

As shown in the terminal above, my installation path is /home/user/AnythingLLMDesktop. I will execute the **"Start"** file

Congradulations, you are almost there!

**SECTION 2: Download and install Ollama to manage LLM providers**

Now, lets install Ollama for model management and a model.

You can simply go to https://ollama.com/ and click **"Download"**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67e1c852-861d-4fb9-9f94-a5a4226d983b)

Once again, I will select Linux Download as i am running a Linux Machine.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/969226a2-dbf7-496c-b994-23145027659f)

You can simply copy BASH code below or get it from the website.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

at the end of the installation, you will receive a message indicating successfull installation that will look something like below.

**SECTION 3: Download and install llama model**

Now, let's go back to Ollama website and navigate to **"Models"** section. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c76c4f26-98b0-48cb-9f3b-fdc5cd6efb21)

There are plenty of different model available here that you can deploy using ollama. I will use a small model for demonstration purposes, but you can branch out if you would like. Just note that larger models will require more RAM and/or VRAM. So choose something your machine can run. 

I chose **llama3.1** model with 8 bln parameters that is roughtly 4.9 GB. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/102f73c7-dd73-45a6-b365-fd3d9f7131d5)

As always you can just copy the command below or get it from the website yourself.

```bash
ollama run llama3.1
```
As you run the command in your terminal, Ollama will download the model if it is not yet available and complete all necessary configurations and start the model. You can start interacting with the model through your terminal if you wish. However, we will go to the next step and configure AnythingLLM to work with the model instead.

**SECTION 4: Configure AnythingLLM to work with Ollama**

Now, lets go back to AnythingLLM and configure it to use Ollama model we just installed. Simply select Ollama from the list of available LLM providers and you will notice that the model will show up automatically. Alternatively, you can select a model if you have multiple models installed.

You can go couple steps forward and read additional details about security and Workspaces. You will be asked to enter a name for a workspace that will be created for you. At the end of the process you will end up  with a fully functional alternative to ChatGPT on your own computer! You can use it without Internet Access!!

**SECTION 5: Set up an agent to have internet access**

Now, let's set up an agent and configure access to the internet. Go to the workspace settings and configure agent to use Ollama model as shown below.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76f8d464-66f9-403d-a706-0a4f35e0e77e)

After you have updated the agent settings, you will be able to configure it using the same button. Click the same button and configure the search engine and access to Web for the agent as shown below.  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/036c76d4-5af5-4ec8-8a25-80a2edf6922a)

For the web search to work, you will need to register a search engine with one of the search engine providers on the list. We will use Google Search Engine provider in this example. Click on the link to register an engine and proceed to your google account and create a new search engine.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb522123-5134-47d9-97cd-c4e4f5b2c958)

You can now Preview or customize the engine you just registered. Go to Customize.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7e86713-16b6-45a2-be43-06325c343682)

Here in the **Overview**, you will find the **"Search Engine ID"** in the **"Basic"** tab. Copy that engine id and paste into the AnythingLLM.
You will also find the API key by going to the **"Programmatic Access"** tab.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2662a7f8-814a-40c7-9fd0-f0fe03197eac)

There you can **"Get a Key"**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b377e468-13f0-42c4-8f89-5a9e64cb9cf5)

Copy that key and paste it into the AnythingLLM as well. Then **"Save"** the changes.

Congradulations!! You are good to go ahead and scrape websites using the agent you just configured! Use **"@agent"** in the chat to initialize the agent before your requests and you should be good to go!
